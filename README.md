### Hi, I'm Alper.

Six years ago, I chose Computer Science because I saw the potential in AI. That decision allowed me to combine analytical thinking with engineering in a way I genuinely enjoy.

My current work ranges from developing platforms for enterprise and prosumer markets to extracting inferences from spatiotemporal video data and solving complex agent-based problems. My focus is on building reliable systems, including designing complete database schemas and policies, developing fullstack software, and engineering end-to-end AI systems from scratch to model fine-tuning.

I manage both public and private repositories here. Let's build and evolve together.
